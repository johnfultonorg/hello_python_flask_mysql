# hello_python_flask_mysql

I wanted to create a simple full-stack application using python.

Front-end is simple html with forms for crud functions

Server is python with flask as a server framework

Database is mysql

Notes of interest:
- Python serve code include some "Hello world" code that's not connected to the webpage, but is kept as an example

- Script for the simple mysql database is in the /etc folder

- Python version 3.8.5 
- Flask verison 1,1,2
- Flask_MySQL version 1.51.
- (I'm not aware of making any decisions based on verison, these just happend to be a compatable set that I dowenloaded)

I found thse links helpful in setting up python and the test of the environment on Windows10 and Visual Studio Code
